Release Notes for PresetMagician 0.6.0
======================================

This release includes many changes, which could also introduce many new bugs. I took my time to test many possible
scenarios, but due to the complexity PresetMagician now has, it's impossible to test everything.

Please make sure you report bugs using the new "Report Bug" functionality, so I can fix these bugs quickly. Should the
bug reporter crash for any reason, you can also email me at felicia@drachenkatze.org.

Note to users of previous versions
==================================

If you have upgraded from a previous version, make sure you review the folder export and file overwriting modes in the
settings. These are set to defaults found in PresetMagician up until 0.5.8.
